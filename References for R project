Mentor: 
There are some interesting relationships to find in the white wine data. I do see some possible avenues of exploration in the residual sugar column and density column (looks like relationships in the scatterplots), and there are some reasonable correlations in the table (in the .4 - .6 range). You are not likely to find perfect correlation between two variables, but I think there is enough there to get started.

That link also includes learning more about:
The knitr package is an extremely powerful tool for dynamic content generation and is worth studying in detail to understand all of itâs features and capabilities. Good resources for learning more about knitr include: <<there are links for those selections>>

    The knitr manual and knitr graphics manual
    The galleries of demos and examples
