# R_Explore_Data

This is a project that I completed for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree R Module. 

I analysed a red and white wine dataset.

The html is too large to open on git hub. 
If you want to review the project, copy it to your desktop and open it.
Or open the rmd document in R.

The pdf document is the review by the Udacity team.

I was a new R learner at this point.
I've since received / completed the Udacity certificate for the Data Analyst Nanodegree, 
but I'm still learning, and will continue learning and practicing. :)

The other documents are background only.
